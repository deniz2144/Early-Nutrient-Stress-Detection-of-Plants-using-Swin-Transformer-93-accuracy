# Early-Nutrient-Stress-Detection-of-Plants-using-Swin-Transformer-93-accuracy
This project is an image generation system that can identify early nutrient stress from plant leaf images. The aim is to detect different types of stress using a deep learning based model. It is developed on PyTorch framework with Swin Transformer architecture
